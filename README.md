# obs-websocket-dotnet
.NET library (written in C#) to communicate with an obs-websocket server.

# This Fork
* This fork was created because I needed to load this into something that used .NET 4.7.2, and one of it's dependencies could not be used in .NET 4.7.2
* This is rewritten to use WatsonWebsocket and not Websocket.Client.
